# Analyze Cell Shape
This code is meant to analyze cell shapes stored in ply files.
Mostly designed for rod-like cells, e.g. yeast.
To segment cell shape, we recommend Limeseg : https://imagej.net/LimeSeg

## Operation
Simple functions to analyze the shape of a single cell, or to compare cells at different stages.

### Single cell analysis.
See demo_single_cell.m

### Comparing states
See demo_summary.m
